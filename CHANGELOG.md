# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Filter mode now defaults to a plain regex matched against the index name — no jq knowledge required. Press `/` again while the filter box is empty ("//") to switch to jq mode, where the typed boolean expression is automatically wrapped in `select(...)`.
- The indices table title now indicates which filter syntax is active ("Filter:" for regex, "jq:" for jq mode).

### Fixed
- Filters that fail at runtime (e.g. an invalid regex) are now caught immediately when typed and surfaced as an error, instead of silently matching every index.
